Which boundary is which is determined by the direction of the flow, i.e. the sign of $a$.  Numerically this may cause problems depending on the discretization we use (if we need a point from the out-flow boundary for instance).  Instead in practice we will get around this by numerically setting a boundary that does not conflict with the out going solution or by using a different one-sided approximation.
