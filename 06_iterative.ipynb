    "\n",
    "For example, if $A$ is a scalar multiple of the identity than these ellipses are actually circles and steepest descent converges in $m$ steps.  If $A$ does not lead to circles, the convergence is based on the ratio between the semi-major and semi-minor axis of the resulting ellipses $m$ dimensional ellipses.  \n",

    "This is controlled by the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ hence why steepest descent grows increasingly difficult as $m$ increases for the Poisson problem.  Note that this also relates to the condition number of the matrix in the $\\ell_2$ norm."
